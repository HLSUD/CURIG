# NUFFT For Radio-astronomical Imaging

## Introduction
We implemented non-uniform Fourier transform to generate dirty images from visibility received by antennas. In order to accelerate the imaging process, GPU is involved to reduce the processing time. Obvious time speedup can be seen compared with the CPU parallel version. And this is our basic version for NUFFT and radio astronomical imaging. For NUFFT, we adopt the ES kernel function for NUFFT and improved W-stacking for imaging. Both general NUFFT and specified one for radio astronomy are provided in this package. 

## Installation

### Requirement
- CUDA Toolkit
- GCC

### Prosedure
1. Get the code in this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/HLSUD/NUFFT.git
```
2. Revise cuda toolkit path and GPU compute architecture in Makefile
    - add ```/your_path/cuda``` at line 22
    - set the correct compute architecture at line 8 (sm_70 for V100, sm_80 for A100)
3. Compiling and libary creating: ``` make ```
4. Running and testing\
    All the executable files are in the bin folder.\
    For TESTING,\
    4.1 NUFFT: convolution, nufft and dft can be tested by typing ```make checkconv``` and ```make checkfft``` respectively.\
    4.2 Radio astronomical imaging: w stacking testing and explicit testing are provided. (```make checkwst``` and ```make explicit_gridder_test```).

### Python interface
Currently, we bind cuda and python simply by ctype. After generating the library by compiling, packages like pycuda, six and numpy are required. Those can be install by run ```pip intall pycuda six numpy```. Then, the curagridder under /NUFFT/python/curagridder/curagridder need to be imported.

The imaging API:
```
dirty = imaging_ms2dirty(uvw, freq, ms, wgt, dirty, fov, epsilon, sigma)
```
uvw - 2d array storing coordinates of visbility, freq - freqency, ms - visibility value (complex number), wgt - weight, dirty - dirty image, fov - field of veiw, epsilon - the tolerance and siamg - upsampling factor.
